## Running React on Repl.it (From Repl.it)

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

## Inspiration and Lessons 

I wanted to get more familiar with learning and using React and decided to build a Todo-List as my first app! 

I decided on building this because I often use a google doc for my Todo-Lists and thought it would be a fun experience to 
try making my own. 

I learned quite a few things while creating this project. 

1) CSS and Webdevelopment in general can depend on the browser! When I tried running this app in FireFox,
   the checkboxes wouldn't actually work. I spent a good 5-6 hours looking through the CSS file for any errors
   and experimenting with the code to figure out the issue and couldn't figure it out until I tried using Chrome.
   This was a good experience though, since it was my first time working with a CSS file!

2) I learned about React components, React States, React props and the use of hooks within an application
   and how it all comes together to make making apps a smoother experience. These parts really showcase why
   one would use this frontend framework.

3) It was my first time working with JavaScript as well, so it was a fun experience to see how JavaScript was different
  from the languages I normally use in my courses or have learned (Python and Java).

## Next Steps and Future Plans 

While this Todo-List App is functional. It's not the prettiest looking app and doesn't have many features that other  
Todo-Lists often come with. So in the future I plan to revisit this project and do the following: 

1) Make it look nicer, considering remaking the CSS file from scratch and learning how to use the bulma library as that's
   used in the industry.

2) Learning to store the tasks on a database instead of local storage so that the tasks can be seen by other's and not just myself.
